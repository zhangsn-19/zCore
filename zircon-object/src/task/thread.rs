/// Runnable / computation entity
///
/// ## SYNOPSIS
///
/// TODO
///
/// ## DESCRIPTION
///
/// The thread object is the construct that represents a time-shared CPU execution
/// context. Thread objects live associated to a particular
/// [Process Object](crate::task::Process) which provides the memory and the handles to other
/// objects necessary for I/O and computation.
///
/// ### Lifetime
/// Threads are created by calling [`Thread::create()`], but only start executing
/// when either [`Thread::start()`] or [`Process::start()`] are called. Both syscalls
/// take as an argument the entrypoint of the initial routine to execute.
///
/// The thread passed to [`Process::start()`] should be the first thread to start execution
/// on a process.
///
/// A thread terminates execution:
/// - by calling [`Thread::exit()`]
/// - when the parent process terminates
/// - by calling [`Task::kill()`]
/// - after generating an exception for which there is no handler or the handler
/// decides to terminate the thread.
///
/// Returning from the entrypoint routine does not terminate execution. The last
/// action of the entrypoint should be to call [`Thread::exit()`].
///
/// Closing the last handle to a thread does not terminate execution. In order to
/// forcefully kill a thread for which there is no available handle, use
/// `KernelObject::get_child()` to obtain a handle to the thread. This method is strongly
/// discouraged. Killing a thread that is executing might leave the process in a
/// corrupt state.
///
/// Fuchsia native threads are always *detached*. That is, there is no *join()* operation
/// needed to do a clean termination. However, some runtimes above the kernel, such as
/// C11 or POSIX might require threads to be joined.
///
/// ### Signals
/// Threads provide the following signals:
/// - [`THREAD_TERMINATED`]
/// - [`THREAD_SUSPENDED`]
/// - [`THREAD_RUNNING`]
///
/// When a thread is started [`THREAD_RUNNING`] is asserted. When it is suspended
/// [`THREAD_RUNNING`] is deasserted, and [`THREAD_SUSPENDED`] is asserted. When
/// the thread is resumed [`THREAD_SUSPENDED`] is deasserted and
/// [`THREAD_RUNNING`] is asserted. When a thread terminates both
/// [`THREAD_RUNNING`] and [`THREAD_SUSPENDED`] are deasserted and
/// [`THREAD_TERMINATED`] is asserted.
///
/// Note that signals are OR'd into the state maintained by the
/// `KernelObject::wait_signal_async()` family of functions thus
/// you may see any combination of requested signals when they return.
///
/// [`Thread::create()`]: Thread::create
/// [`Thread::exit()`]: Thread::exit
/// [`Process::exit()`]: crate::task::Process::exit
/// [`THREAD_TERMINATED`]: crate::object::Signal::THREAD_TERMINATED
/// [`THREAD_SUSPENDED`]: crate::object::Signal::THREAD_SUSPENDED
/// [`THREAD_RUNNING`]: crate::object::Signal::THREAD_RUNNING
